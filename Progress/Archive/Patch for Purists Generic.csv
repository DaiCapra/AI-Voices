It will be more trouble tracking him down than killing him. Take a boat from Sadrith Mora to Tel Aruhn. Swim southwest until you reach the coast. Odaishah Yasalmibaal has built his yurt right on the coast near the end of a small peninsula.

Caldera is in our territory, and we should have gotten the charter. Worse yet, Hlaalu is skimming the top off the Imperial fatcat company that got the charter. Since it's an Imperial company, we can't even get a House War contract on it. It'll come to violence, you mark my words."
